# Introduction #

I did this work for a consulting project and I want to open source it, but we have to do some work before it can be free like beer.  I do want to provide the source code, so if you want it you need to agree right now to remove all trademarks, branding and original logos from the site and templates before pushing it out to a public website.

Immediate Goals:
  * remove corporate branding
  * resubmit to the source trunk
  * clean up and fix existing issues
  * ex... IE does not do timers the same as firefox
